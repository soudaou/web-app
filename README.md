# My XERCISE planner

This amazing application will make you excited and ready to exercise all the time. 

It will spice up your routine every week and you will never be bored again.

##Application Features:

-	Create a list that has all the different kinds of sports and activities you enjoy 

	and the application will generate a random schedule for you each week.

-	The application will also have a map with directions that will locate gyms 

	and parks near you depending on what the activity is for a specific day.

##My learning goals:

I want to be proficient in PHP, JavaScript, jQuery and SQL. I hope this project will teach me a lot and make me a better developer.

##Technologies or techniques I will be exploring:

- 	Responsive web design.

- 	Google Maps integration.

## Similar applications and reflections on the differences with my app:

I was not able to find an application that had the same idea as mine.
Iï¿½m a FIRST!!!

###The applications that I searched and compared were the followings:

#### -miCoach (for adidas)

The miCoach is an application that gives the user different workouts with different levels, were you can track 
how you are doing It also has a GPS so you can know where you are if you are running for instance. 

#####Differences: My app will let the user choose the exercises/activities they want. 

This way they will be doing what they want.

#### -NTC (for Nike)

The NTC app is similar to the miCoach in many ways. It gives you the workouts and you can save 

them and you can keep progress of how you did. For every workout you do and you do a great job you get a workout reward. 

This keeps you motivated and proud of what you did.

#####Differences: My app will let the user keep track of what they did at the end of each day.

#### -BodyRock.tv

This is a great app it has all videos of different workout done almost every day. 

The host will explain the rules before and after she will tell you how amazing this workout was. 

You can choose the videos you like as your favorites and watch them whenever you want.

You can chitchat with other members that follow this app as well.

#####Differences: My app will let the user decide what exercises/activities they want to do each week. 

They are in control.

##My ideal user is:

My ideal user will be a motivated person that is always looking for something new in their life.
 
They want a schedule that they can commit to. The user will want to be challenged frequently. 

The user wants something to challenge them, using this weekly routine and having the user list their favorite activities will defiantly keep them motivated and excited.

My friend Erika loves to exercise all the time, but sometimes she feels unmotivated because she keeps doing the same routine from week to week. 

She gets bored and then decides not to do anything. 
This app is going to change her exercise routine for good.
